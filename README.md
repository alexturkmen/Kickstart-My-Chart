Homework Week 1 Notes
1. In the "Date_Pivot" tab, I filtered off the "live" projects because they were filtered off in the example picture given in the GitLab homework instructions. 
2. In the pivot table tabs, one of the headers in table is "count of state" whereas in the examples given in GitLab homework instructions this header was named "Count of Outcome". The only differnce is the name of the header, they function in the same way.
